Cursor?

Cursor is a pointer to a memory  area called context area.

Assigned to hold the information about the processing of a SELECT 
statement or DML statment.

Context area?

Context area is a memory region inside the PGA
which helps oracle server in processing an SQL
statement by holding the important information
about that statement.

Rows returned by a query.
Number of rows processed by a query.

Using  cursor you can control the context area as it is a pointer
to the same.


There are two type of cursor

 Implicit Cursor

Automatically created by the oracle server
User cannot control the behavior of these cursors.

Oracle server creates an implicit cursor for any
PL/SQL block which executed an SQL statement.
---------------------------------------------
Explicit Cursor

Explicit cursors are user defined cursors


Steps for creating an Explicit Cursor

Declare
open
fetch
close

Declare
	Declaring a cursor means initializing a cursor into memory.

Syntax of Declare

	CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;
-------------------------------------------------------------
open
	in order to put that cursor to work we have to open it first.

	when you open a cursor the memory will be alloted to it


Syntax of Open
	OPEN cursor_name;
-------------------------------------------------

Fetch

The process of retrieving the data from the cursor is called fetching.

Syntax of Fetch

FETCH cursor_name INTO pl/variable;

		or
FETCH cursor_name INTO pl/record;
------------------------------------------------

Close

When the server comes across the closing statement of a cursor
it will all the resources associated with it;

Syntax of Close

CLOSE cursor_name;

----------------------------------------------
Basic Programming structure

declare
	cursor cursor_name is select_statement;
begin
	open cursor_name;
	fetch cursor_name into pl_sql variable;
	close cursor_name;
end;
